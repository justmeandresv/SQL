Left join: Here I am using a left join to gather info on which VIPs have rsvp'd to events.
SELECT vips.last_name
,vips.first_name
FROM vips
LEFT JOIN reservations res
ON vips.member_id=res.member_id
WHERE welcome_rsvp=1
AND dinner_rsvp=1;

Inner Join: Here I'm using an inner join to obtain info on which members are staying at which hotel along with hotel info.
SELECT res.member_id
,hotels.hotel_name
,hotels.address
FROM hotels
INNER JOIN reservations res
ON res.hotel=hotels.hotel_id
;

Right join: I'm using a right join here to get more detailed info on which members are at which hotel and their names.
SELECT res.member_id
,vips.first_name
,vips.last_name
,hotels.hotel_name
FROM reservations res
RIGHT JOIN vips 
ON  res.member_id=vips.member_id
INNER JOIN hotels
ON hotels.hotel_id=res.hotel;

Inner query: I am using a nested query here to narrow down which events are a part of the research division.
SELECT DISTINCT event_name
FROM events
WHERE event_id IN(SELECT event 
                  FROM vips
                  WHERE assoc_type='research');
                  
Inner query: I am once again using an nested query to show who gives feedback and who receives feedback for events.
SELECT member_id, first_name, last_name, provides_feedback_to
FROM vips
WHERE member_id IN (SELECT  provides_feedback_to
                    FROM vips)
